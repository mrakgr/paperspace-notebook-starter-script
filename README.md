# Paperspace Notebook Starter Script

A little script that I've been using to start free tier Paperspace notebooks.

After you have downloaded this repo and unpacked it, first install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install the missing libraries using `pip install`. For example:

```
pip install gradient
pip install plyer
```

Then you will be able to run the script from the command line.

The script has been created for the Youtube series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL04PGV4cTuIVGO5ImYTk9wPVmbgdYbe7J
